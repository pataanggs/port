## Introduction

This is my personal portfolio website, developed using modern web technologies like **React** for UI components and **Vite** for a fast development build system. The goal of this project is to highlight my projects, work experience, skills, and contact information in an interactive and responsive way.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Fast navigation with no page reloads.
- **Project Showcases**: Detailed project descriptions with links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **Contact Form**: Simple contact form to send inquiries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pataanggs/port.git
    cd port
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your portfolio at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

### Running the Development Server

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite server and open your portfolio on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

After building, you can preview the production version locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Project Structure

The basic project structure follows the standard Vite + React setup:

```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
- `npm run build`: Bundles the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build for preview.

## Dependencies

Key dependencies used in this project:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast development.
- **React Router** (if applicable): To handle client-side routing.
- **Sass** or **CSS Modules** (if applicable): For styling components.

Full list of dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file.

## Configuration

You can modify the default configurations for Vite in the `vite.config.js` file. This may include setting up path aliases, plugins, or environment variables.

If you use environment variables (like API keys), create a `.env` file at the root of your project and add your environment variables:

```
